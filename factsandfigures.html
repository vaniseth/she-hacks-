            <h2> INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE </h2>
            <p>
                Hygiene in manufacturing is vital for protecting public health and wellbeing, as well as ensuring product quality.
                
                Manufacturing hygiene aims to prevent product contamination that may occur through the introduction of unwanted materials, substances or microorganisms into a manufactured good or process.
                
                Hygiene in manufacturing is vital, since a contaminated production batch has the potential to affect the health of many people, or to result in spoilage and waste

            <h2> COMMERCIAL HYGIENE </h2>
            <p>
                Hygiene in the commercial sector is very important but is very different from domestic and industrial hygiene.

                With many businesses, one of the biggest differences is the amount of space to be cleaned. Cleaning your three-bedroom house differs a lot from cleaning a 100-room hotel. For this reason, commercial cleaning is likely to use heavier, industrial methods for getting things clean.

                Commercial sector will often have larger and stronger pieces of cleaning equipment, from carpet cleaners to floor buffers.

            <h2> DOMESTIC HYGIENE </h2>
            <p>
                Domestic hygiene activities include all the jobs which are done to keep the house and people's clothes and bedding clean. These jobs include sweeping and washing floors, cleaning the toilet, washing clothes and bedding, and washing dishes and cooking utensils after meals.
