            <div class="wer">The concept of sanitation broadly includes liquid and solid waste disposal, personal and food related hygiene and domestic as well as environmental hygiene.
                <p>At present the extent of sanitation coverage in India is around 16 percent of all rural households. This figure is one of the lowest in the world, at par with countries like Niger and Afghanistan and possibly lower than Bangladesh.The concept of sanitation was earlier limited to disposal of human excreta by cesspools, open ditches, pit latrines, bucket system etc. To-day, it denotes a comprehensive concept of not only the methods of disposal of human waste but also of liquid and solid wastes including matter originating from food and hygiene. It is viewed as a package.</p>

       <div class="yui">Central Rural Sanitation Programme (CRSP), a centrally sponsored Rural Sanitation Programme was launched in 1986. Its objective is to improve the quality of life of the rural people and provide privacy and dignity to women. It was designated to provide sanitary latrines to the SCs/STs, landless labourers and people living below poverty line and the resources were shared by the central and state governments on 50: 50 basis.

        The programme was planned with the objective of providing clean, healthy and environmentally acceptable disposal of excreta with a view to create good sanitation and consequent improved health standards. The CRSP is implemented in different states and union territories for improving sanitation facilities through construction of sanitary latrines for individual households.
        <p>
            Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) was initiated on 1st April 1999 under sector reform process. The campaign is community led and people centred. It was launched after restructuring Central Rural Sanitation Programme and is operational in 451 districts with an out IAY of Rs. 4,416 crores in which community contribution is Rs. 812 crore.

Catchment Area Approach (CAA) has been adopted for monitoring and surveillance by involving various grass roots level educational and technical institutions by utilizing existing resources and strengthening them by providing additional financial resources.
The unprecedented sanitation challenge requires new strategies and methods to improve and promote sanitation, which should be accessible to everyone in rural areas. Through the creation of demand and behaviour change Instead of awareness generation to improve physical quality of life in rural areas: sanitation coverage among rural population will be accelerated.

Toilet facilities especially in all the primary and upper primary schools and integrated sanitary complexes, exclusively for women, would certainly create a kind of ownership among the needy segment of the community. Suitable, cost effective local based affordable multiple designs of individual household toilets should be encouraged. New partners like co-operative milk societies, sugarcane farmers associations and big industries can adopt communities/blocks and promote rural sanitation in their own geographical areas.</p>
