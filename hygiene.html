            <p>If you have a personal hygiene problem, odor isn't the only issue. In fact, poor hygiene spreads illness,
                according to the Centers for Disease Control. It also affects interpersonal relationships, social
                interactions and job or school performance. Good hygiene, on the other hand, makes you come off as a
                capable
                person with self-worth and self-confidence. Good personal hygiene also helps you stay healthy,
                clean-looking
                and attractive.</p>

            <p>Every time you touch a surface, sneeze, prepare food, change a diaper, handle your pet or use the
                bathroom,
                you pick up potentially harmful organisms, according to the CDC. Simple acts such as regular bathing and
                hand washing can stop you from transmitting cold, flu and infections caused by viruses and bacteria on
                your
                skin. When you don't wash regularly, not only can you harbor and spread these bacteria and viruses, but
                you're more likely to contract the illnesses they cause. If you have skin irritation or a wound, poor
                hygiene will likely lead to infection. Proper hygiene also helps to maintain healthy skin pH and skin
                strength. Your skin is a barrier from disease and good hygiene helps your skin more effectively provide
                that
                protection.</p>

            <p>Appearances broadcast more than just how we look to the world. For example, when you present to a job
                interview well-dressed, displaying good hygiene, you look like a capable professional, able to handle
                yourself with care and respect. If you appear with poor hygiene, even if you're the most qualified
                candidate, it may send the message that you're sloppy, you don't care about your performance and you
                don't
                value and respect yourself. If your hygiene declines in school or the workplace, it can lead people to
                question your abilities and even your mental and physical health. At the very least, good hygiene in the
                workplace or school environment avoids creating unnecessary distractions to those around you.</p>

        Diarrhea that lasts for more than 2-4 weeks is considered persistent or chronic. In an otherwise healthy person,
        chronic diarrhea can be a nuisance at best or become a serious health issue. For someone who has a weakened

        Remain well hydrated and avoid dehydration. Serious health problems can occur if the body does not maintain
        proper fluid levels. Diarrhea may become worse and hospitalization may be required if dehydration occurs.

            <h4>Poor personal hygiene leaves visible signs of poor health on a person’s body. Signs of poor health keep
                many
                people at distance to avoid getting a disease.

                For example, many people naturally avoid those who sneeze and cough in their face without covering the
                mouth.

                So if you expect that people will tell you to take a shower when you need to, they won’t. Once noticing
                your
                personal hygiene issues they’ll politely leave the room leaving with your problems alone.

                That makes sense.

                It’s your job to control your body odor. That’s why it’s called “personal hygiene”. </h4>

                Bad message. Right?

                That poor message also negatively affects your efforts at work, for example.

                Let's say that you, daily, meet clients face to face.

                Your customers would enjoy working with you if you’d have a professional look and meet them with a
                friendly

                physical appearance.
